Stir with a large spoon and mix it properly. Taste for the salt and add as required. Pani is ready; place it in a refrigerator for at least 1-hour before serving or use it at room temperature. If you like soft boondi, mix it now. If you like crispy taste of boondi then mix it at the time of serving.\r\n Take mashed potato, kala chana, red chilli powder, cumin-coriander powder, chaat masala powder, coriander leaves and salt (add only if you have not added while boiling the potatoes and chana) in a bowl.\r\n Mix them together with a spoon. Masala is ready.\r\n Take each puri and gently make a large hole on its top-middle side with a spoon or your index finger or thumb for stuffing.\r\n Stuff it with masala (more or less, as you like). Sprinkle onion and sev over it and drizzle a drop of date tamarind chutney over it. Take pani-puri water in a medium bowl. Dip each puri in water and enjoy\u2026",

Take the finely chopped or grated veggies in a bowl.  you will need \u00bd cup finely chopped red cabbage, \u00bd cup grated carrot, \u00bc cup finely chopped capsicum (green bell pepper), \u00bc cup finely chopped french beans and \u00bc cup finely chopped spring onions.\r\n2. Then add the dry ingredients \u2013 2 tablespoons corn starch, 2 tablespoons all purpose flour (maida), \u00bd teaspoon black pepper and \u00bd teaspoon salt or add as required.\r\n3. Mix and gather the whole mixture together. Then kind of mix and knead so that the veggies leave the water and you get a dough-like mixture. But do not knead like that a bread or roti dough. Gluten strands can form that will give a dense chewy texture in the fried veggie balls. So just mix very well and press so that the veggies release their juices.\r\n4. Then take a small portion of the mixture in your hands.\r\n5. Press and roll it in your palm and make a round veggie ball.\r\n6. Make all veggie balls this way and keep aside. You can spread some oil on your palms while making the vegetable balls.\r\n7. Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Add a small piece of a ball to the hot oil. If the balls does not stick or settle down at the bottom of the pan, but comes up steadily the oil is ready for frying these veggie balls. If the balls break, then some more binding agent is required. So you can add 2 to 3 teaspoons of some more all-purpose flour (maida).\r\n8. Gently place the balls in the hot oil. The oil has to be medium hot. Too much heat and the manchurian balls will be browned from top and uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the balls absorb too much oil.\r\n9. When cooked from one side, turn the balls with a slotted spoon.\r\n10. Fry the balls till crisp and golden turning them over a couple of times. Remove them with a slotted or perforated spoon and drain as much as oil as possible.\r\n12. Place the fried manchurian balls on kitchen paper towels. For a low-fat version, you can cook the veggie balls in an appe-appam pan or \u00e6bleskiver pan. Fry the veg balls this way in batches and keep aside.",

Next heat 5 to 6 cups of water in a pan.\r\n3. Then when the water comes to a boil, add \u00bd teaspoon salt.\r\n4.  Next add \u00bd teaspoon oil and mix well. Add any neutral oil.\r\n5. Then add the noodles (about 200 grams). I have used whole wheat noodles. The recipe is customizable with any noodles \u2013 instant, ramen, soba, chow mein, udon, rice.\r\n6.  Now boil until the noodles are cooked al dente.\r\n7. Be sure to check the doneness throughout the noodles recipe by pressing a few noodles or tasting them. They should be softened, but still have a slight bite to them.\r\n8. Then drain the cooked noodles in a colander or sieve.\r\n9. Next rinse the noodles with fresh water.\r\n10. After that, set aside. You can even toss the noodles recipe with 2 to 3 teaspoons oil if desired.\r\n11. Now heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame oil in a wok or pan. Keep the heat to low or medium-low. Add 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic and 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger.\r\n12. Next stir-fry or saut\u00e9 for some seconds.\r\n13. Then increase the flame to high and add \u2153 cup chopped spring onions (scallions).\r\n14. After that, keep on stirring continuously and stir fry the onions until they become translucent.\r\n15. Then add thinly sliced french beans (about 8 to 10 beans which have been thinly sliced).\r\n16. Next continue to stir fry for 2 to 3 minutes on a medium to high heat.\r\n17. Then add the veggies: \u00bd cup shredded carrots, \u2153 cup thinly sliced capsicum and 1 cup shredded cabbage.\r\n18. Now continue to toss and stir fry on a medium to high heat until the veggies are almost cooked. If possible it is best to use a pan with handles as it is better to lift it while tossing. \r\n19. Some crunch should be there in the vegetables, so don\u2019t cook the vegetables until they become completely soft\r\n20. Then add 1 to 2 teaspoons of finely chopped celery. You can skip celery if you do not have it.",

Stir in between occasionally to prevent sticking.\r\n4. To check whether pasta are cooked or not, bite one pasta. If it is too hard to bite or is white in the center, it is raw and requires cooking little longer. If it is slightly firm to bite, then it means it is cooked to al dente. If you want your pasta to be very soft, cook them for 2-3 minutes more once they are al dente.\r\n5. Drain the water by carefully transferring the cooked pasta to large strainer (or a colander).\r\n6. While pasta is cooking, you can make the red pasta sauce by following this red tomato pasta sauce recipe. Add sauce in a pan and heat it over medium flame.\r\n7. Add cooked pasta and mix well.

        "description": "1. Take 1\u00bd cups sugar, 3-4 green cardamoms (or 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder) and 8-10 saffron strands in a deep pan.\r\n2. Add 2\u00bd cups water and bring mixture to boil over high flame. When it comes to rolling boil, reduce flame to medium and cook until sugar syrup is little sticky, it will take around 10-12 minutes. Stir occasionally in between. Turn off the flame. Sugar syrup is ready. After deep frying jamuns in later step, heat the sugar syrup for 4-5 minutes.\r\n3. Prepare 1 cup mawa by following the recipe given above or use readymade mawa. Crumble it using hand or grate it using a grater. Add 1/8 teaspoon baking soda and 1/2 cup sifted maida.\r\n4. Mix them gently using a spoon.\r\n5. As you can see, the flour is easily mixed with mawa because of moisture in mawa.\r\n6. Knead all of them together until smooth dough is prepared. If required add a few teaspoons of milk to knead a smooth and soft dough (add one teaspoon milk at a time until smooth consistency of dough is achieved, do not add large amount in single go).\r\n7. Divide dough into 16-18 equal parts, grease hands with ghee and make smooth surfaced balls from it. Make sure that there is no crack on the surface of balls because it will make jamuns to crack open while deep frying. If you are not able to form crack-less balls, then you need to make dough bit softer. To do this, add milk in dough, knead it again and roll the balls again. Do not make very large balls because they will increase in size after deep frying and soaking in syrup.\r\n8. Heat ghee or oil (or 1/2 ghee and 1/2 oil) in a pan over medium flame. When ghee is medium hot, add a pinch of dough in hot ghee and if it comes upward immediately without changing it\u2019s color, ghee is ready. If it turns brown immediately, ghee is too hot. If it doesn\u2019t come upward, ghee is cold. Add prepared dough balls (4-6 at a time or depending on the size of a pan) and deep-fry them over low to medium flame. As you can see they will turn light golden and increase in size after a minute. If the jamuns turn dark brown immediately then the temperature of ghee is too hot, pour some cold ghee in to ghee to reduce the temperature.\r\n9. After 3-4 minutes, they will turn light golden brown.\r\n10. Deep fry them until they turn golden brown, it will take around 6-7 minutes. Cooking them evenly is the key to soft and textured gulab jamuns, increase or decrease flame intensity to keep the temperature of ghee even while frying them.\r\n11. Drain and transfer them over kitchen napkin and let them cool for 5-minutes. As you can see, the balls are increased in size after deep frying. Do not add them directly into warm sugar syrup.\r\n12. Add fried balls into warm sugar syrup (not hot syrup). If you add them into hot syrup, they will shrink in size.\r\n13. Soak them for at least 1-2 hours before serving. As you can see in the picture, the jammuns are increased to almost double in size. Gulab jamuns are ready for serving. Serve them warm or chilled.",
